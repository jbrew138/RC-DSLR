<b>UW Tacoma 2016 Senior Project</b>

This project was a prototype device, which allows a user to control the cameraâ€™s tilt, pan, zoom, and focus operations from an Android application. This device was designed to allow for live remote monitoring and controlling of camera operations for a Canon DSLR Camera.

Included in the app folder is the source code and layout xml of the app along with an example version of the app in an apk. The APK shows the use of dial controls, but the webview won't load as it was an earlier version of the app set to use a specific local IP.

<b>Some background into the creation of the app</b>  
The project suffered some setbacks later on with an emergency for one of the team members primarily in charge of working on the app. I had to step in during the final stages and help create a working version of the app with no real knowledge of doing so. If the team was to continue the project outside of school, we would have liked to polish several aspects of it, including the app.
