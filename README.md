# RC-DSLR
UW Tacoma 2016 Senior Project

This project was a prototype single, affordable device, which will allow a user to control the
cameraâ€™s tilt, pan, zoom, and focus operations from an Android application. This
device was designed to allow for live remote monitoring and controlling of camera operations for a Canon DSLR Camera.

Included in the app folder is the source code and layout xml of the app along with an example version of the app in an apk. The APK shows the use of dial controls, but the webview won't load as it was an earlier version of the app set to use a specific local IP.
